            <img src="alex.mom.jpg" alt="Islam">
            <p class="short-line">In the southern heartland of Sudan,
                amidst the arid landscapes and the relentless sun,
                there lies a village called Kalkada. It was here that
                I Islam Omar Hemada came into the world, born into a family of
                thirty members. Life in Kalkada was marked by enduring hardships,
                where even the most basic necessities, such as food, education,
                and clothing, were often elusive dreams.
                In my eyes, education was the key to breaking freedom from the
                relentless cycle of poverty that had gripped my family and the
                village for generations. Despite the scarcity of resources and
                limited access to quality education, I was determined to learn.
                Against all odds, I completed my primary education.
                However, adversity only fueled my determination. I completed my
                high school education, demonstrating a remarkable commitment to
                learning despite obstacles. As I pursued my dreams, my family back
                in Kalkada supported me emotionally, holding onto the hope that my
                sacrifice would lead to a brighter future.

                One of my primary objectives is to empower the youth of Kalkada
                through education and skill development. I believed that by
                providing access to quality education and vocational training,
                I Would break the cycle of poverty that had gripped the village
                for generations.

                    <p class="short-line">This is the project we worked on in team of two where all the development
                        and testing was runned over an operating system
                        Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using programming language Python 3.8.3.
                        The console create your data model manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console /
                        command interpreter store,
                        and persist objects to a file (JSON file) The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage
                        system.
                        This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and
                        persisted”.
                        This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and
                        RestAPI you will build later,
                        you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.
